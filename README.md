# create-project-skeleton

## Motivation

A lot of times when building react projects, I end up using create react vite and then delete the extra stuff that comes with it. I needed a way to do scaffold a completely empty hello world project.

## Usage

`npx create-project-skeleton`

To create an empty hello world project choose the options that start with "Empty".

## Future work

Add more starter hello world templates.
